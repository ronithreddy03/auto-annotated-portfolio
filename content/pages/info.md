      # Hey â€” I'm Ronith Reddy Prodduturi

      **Developer â€¢ Digital Artist â€¢ Consultant**

      I build data-driven products, clean data pipelines, and visuals people
      actually use. Based in **Dallas, TX** (open to TX/CA & remote).
      Lately I've shipped fraud-detection prototypes, time-series forecasts,
      and music analytics dashboards that turn messy data into clear decisions.
      Curious, fast, and pragmaticâ€”if you like shipping, keep scrolling! ðŸš€
